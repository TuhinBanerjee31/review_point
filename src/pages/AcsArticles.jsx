          History and Growth
        </h3>
        <h5 className="text-lg tracking-wider max-w-screen-xl mx-auto">
          ACS was formed through the merger of Construcciones Aeronáuticas S.A.
          and OCP Construcciones. Its roots, however, trace back to the early
          20th century. Over the years, the company expanded its operations both
          domestically and internationally, acquiring various construction and
          engineering firms to enhance its capabilities. Key acquisitions, such
          as the purchase of Dragados, a major Spanish construction company,
          solidified ACS’s position as a leader in the industry. Today, ACS
          operates in more than 50 countries and employs over 180,000 people,
          making it one of the largest construction firms globally. The company
          is listed on the Madrid Stock Exchange and is a member of the IBEX 35
          index, reflecting its financial strength and stability.
