          History and Growth
        </h3>
        <h5 className="text-lg tracking-wider max-w-screen-xl mx-auto">
          Bechtel was founded in 1898 by Warren A. Bechtel, who began his career
          by building railroad tracks in the American West. The company quickly
          grew, branching into different sectors and expanding its capabilities.
          By the 1930s, Bechtel was involved in large-scale projects such as the
          Hoover Dam, marking its entry into massive infrastructure development.
          Over the years, Bechtel evolved from a regional contractor to a global
          engineering and construction giant. The company expanded
          internationally in the 1960s and 1970s, becoming a key player in the
          oil and gas industry and building some of the world's most iconic
          energy and infrastructure projects. Now in its fifth generation of
          family leadership, Bechtel continues to grow, operating in nearly 40
          countries.
