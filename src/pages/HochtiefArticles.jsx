          History and Growth
        </h3>
        <h5 className="text-lg tracking-wider max-w-screen-xl mx-auto">
          Hochtief was founded by the engineer and contractor, Friedrich Alfred
          Krupp, initially focusing on railway construction and civil
          engineering. Over the years, the company expanded its operations,
          taking on larger and more complex projects. Hochtief became a publicly
          traded company in 1999 and has since grown its international presence
          through strategic acquisitions and partnerships. In the early 2000s,
          Hochtief expanded its operations into the United States, Australia,
          and other international markets. The acquisition of companies such as
          Turner Construction (U.S.) and Leighton Holdings (Australia) has
          helped Hochtief establish a strong foothold in these regions and
          diversify its service offerings.
