          History and Evolution
        </h3>
        <h5 className="text-lg tracking-wider max-w-screen-xl mx-auto">
          Kiewit was founded in 1884 by Peter Kiewit as a small masonry
          contracting business. Over the years, the company expanded from its
          local roots into a major player in national and international
          construction. The firm took a pivotal role in large-scale
          infrastructure projects, particularly during the mid-20th century,
          when it became a key contractor for the U.S. government during World
          War II and in the post-war economic boom. Peter Kiewit's leadership,
          particularly from the 1920s until his death in 1979, was instrumental
          in the company's rise. He instilled a culture of quality,
          accountability, and innovation, which continues to guide the firm
          today.
